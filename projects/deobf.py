Idea that me removing his announcements spam means he cannot \"work on his project in peace\" while still being allowed to post about it in every other channel and thread is absurd. The vibe I'm starting to get is that he thinks his project is superior to CEO which is a great mindset for development motivation but completely idiotic in practice if he expects to just hijack the entire OOCBA discord for his prototype. No idea what the prismata situation was but I've seen the screenshots of his prismata mod and it has such a horrible aesthetics that casual prismata players looking at a glance would probably assume it's some kind of knockoff or meme or spam, and I'm assuming he posted screenshots of it there hundreds of times... did he then try to take the place of the game's developer and tableflip when people didn't say that his mod was somehow superior to the actual god-tier game he was building from in the first place? IMO this is all very silly dramaqueen fiasco, especially because I'm not even opposed to him having an active thread here dedicated to his game or posting about it everywhere...  seems like I've drawn the line at literally-spamming-announcements and he wants to act like he was made into a martyr\" -The Spaghetti Monster\n","queen","evilmovecounter","#restart","geo=1","metamovetarget=40","<h2 style=\"background: #9505; padding: 5px; border-radius: 6px;\">Counter Counter Counter</h2>Counts the count of counters that count counters in this encounter.","todespoked","#grid","<h2 class=\"doublecounter\" style=\"padding: 5px; border-radius: 6px\">Doublemove Counter</h2>Counts the number of moves plus the number of moves. great new counters idcly","<h2 style=\"background: #fff5; padding: 5px; border-radius: 6px;\">Counterattack Counter</h2>Counts the count of counters this counter has attacked this encounter.
